/**
 * From what the card reports to what the factory's `setMatchUpStatus` reads.
 *
 * CA, 2026-10-08: *"Shouldn't the new score entry modal be built in such a way that it cleanly
 * understands and integrates with the factory setMatchUpStatus method?"* It should, and until now the
 * mapping lived in a stories helper, which meant every host had to rebuild it. It lives here, the
 * dialog applies it on Submit, and a host hands the result to the engine as its `outcome`.
 *
 * Every line is a MEASURED difference between the two shapes (2026-10-01 against factory 7.4.0, re-measured
 * 2026-10-05 against 7.5.0; pinned in `src/stories/__tests__/scoringStories.test.ts`):
 *
 *   - the engine reads `outcome.score.sets`, `winningSide`, `matchUpStatus`, `matchUpStatusCodes` and
 *     `matchUpFormat`, and nothing else; the card's `score` STRING is refused outright, and `sets` at the
 *     top level are ignored (a winner is recorded with NO score);
 *   - a reason travels as a POSITIONAL `matchUpStatusCodes` array: the side that did not win, at its
 *     index, for a single exit; both for a double exit; index 0 for an ending that resolves nobody;
 *   - it is sent only when a reason was chosen, because an empty array BLANKS the codes and a played
 *     result with no reason must not erase one a previous edit recorded;
 *   - a clear is `{ score: { sets: [] }, matchUpStatusCodes: [] }`: `{}` or `{ cleared: true }` leaves the
 *     stale score standing as IN_PROGRESS, and the codes survive a clear unless blanked;
 *   - a format chosen through the chip rides along as `matchUpFormat`, which the engine persists once it
 *     accepts the result; otherwise the change is lost.
 *
 * `setMatchUpStatus` MUTATES the outcome it is handed (it writes the derived score strings into it), so a
 * host that logs or reuses what it sent should pass a copy.
