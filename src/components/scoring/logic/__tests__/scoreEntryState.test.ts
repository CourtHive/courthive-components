/**
 * The redesigned card's state model.
 *
 * The property that matters most here is a NEGATIVE one: this module must not contain a second copy
 * of the walkover rule. Every assertion about an outcome is therefore also an assertion that
 * `resolveIrregularEnding` was asked the right question — which is why the double-exit and
 * fail-closed cases are tested here even though they are tested there too. A mapping that asks the
 * wrong question produces a wrong outcome from a correct resolver, and only a test at this level
 * catches it.
 *
 * The one genuinely new piece of derivation is the side inversion: an ending is recorded against the
 * side it HAPPENED TO, and the winner is the other side. That is what lets the separate winner
 * question be deleted rather than redesigned, so it gets its own named test.
